# My experience

I found this task challanging as i aligned everything with the design file and my expectations. There were a few new thing that i learned during development.
However i know that its not perfect, i could spend a few days fixing the small details that i missed.

Also i messed up my branch by forcefully pushing changes from another branch. That is the reason why there are only two commits. :)

I hope you will like my work as i enjoyed making it.  
Have a great day!
